# Brain_Tumor_treatment
This project's aim is to help doctors to treat brain tumor easily. This project contains four different models each with a different purpose. The first model <b>Brain Tumor Detection</b> takes the patient MRI Scans and predict whether the person has tumor or not.<br><br>
The second model is <b>Brain Tumor segmentation</b>. This model segments the region inside the brain which is affected from the tumor. It will segment the tumor into four layers i.e. flair, seg, t1 and t2.<br><br>
The third model is <b>Tumor Classification</b>. This model classifies the tumor into two categories <b>High Grade Gliomas(HGG)</b> and <b>Low Grade Gliomas(LGG)</b>. These are two different stages of the brain cancer, former being the more critical. <br><br>
The final model is <b>Survival_rate</b>. This model divide the patients with HGG into two categories based on their survival rate. The first class is the <b>survival of a period of less than a year</b> and the second one is<b> survival of greater than a year</b>.
